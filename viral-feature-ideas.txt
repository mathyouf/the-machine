VIRAL FEATURE IDEAS — THE MACHINE
Research-backed features designed to produce shareable identity artifacts
================================================================================

Meta-principle: Make the data about YOU the shareable artifact, not the experience
itself. Nobody screenshots "I played a game." Everybody screenshots "here's what
the game revealed about me." Every feature below produces a personalized data
visualization that functions as identity content — the modern equivalent of posting
your Spotify Wrapped or your natal chart.

================================================================================

1. STATED vs. REVEALED PREFERENCES
   Source: Joel et al. (2020) — 11,196 couples, stated preferences predict 0% of
   actual romantic desire

   Before session: ask Scroller to rank the five dimensions ("I think I like
   cerebral content most"). After session: show actual dwell-time data side by
   side. The gap between what you think you like and what you actually watch is
   almost always shocking — and extremely screenshottable.

   Shareable moment: "I thought I was a cerebral person but I'm actually communal"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. "WE KNEW IN 20 SECONDS" COUNTDOWN
   Source: Scott et al. (2022) — 20 seconds of scrolling predicts Big Five

   Show the Optimizer's uncertainty map freezing into confidence surprisingly
   early. The Scroller sees: "By 47 seconds, your Optimizer already knew you'd
   love that cooking video." The speed at which you become legible to a stranger
   is unsettling in a way people want to share.

   Shareable moment: "It took 3 videos to figure me out"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. TASTE FINGERPRINT (Behavioral Zodiac)
   Source: Kosinski, Stillwell & Graepel (2013) — Likes predict personality better
   than coworkers can

   Make the UMAP shareable as a standalone identity artifact. "I'm a
   high-Aesthetic, mid-Dark, zero-Communal." Give it a visual identity distinct
   enough that people recognize it on sight in a feed. Zodiac is fake but viral
   because it gives people identity language. This is real AND viral for the same
   reason.

   Shareable moment: The taste fingerprint image — designed as profile-picture-ready

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. TASTE TWIN vs. TASTE OPPOSITE
   Source: Fricke & Herzberg (2017) — Same genre, opposite personalities depending
   on which attributes drew them

   Match two people who like the same topics but for different psychological
   reasons. One likes cooking for warmth, the other for aesthetics. Show divergent
   dwell patterns on identical videos. "You both watched the same cooking video.
   One of you watched the hands. The other watched the faces."

   Shareable moment: Paired screenshots — two people posting divergent reactions

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. "GUILTY SCROLL" METRIC
   Source: Meta Reels RecSys (2026) — Watch time so misleading Meta had to
   directly ask users if they liked what they watched

   Surface which videos the Scroller watched for a long time but — based on
   overall pattern — probably didn't enjoy (high dwell, low pattern-match to
   preference vector). "You spent 45 seconds on this video but your taste profile
   says you shouldn't have liked it. What happened?"

   Shareable moment: "Why did I watch that for so long?"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. DARK TRIAD DIMENSION
   Source: Manolika (2023) — Extraversion insignificant once you control for
   Openness and Dark Triad, which actually drive media preferences

   Most personality products only show flattering Big Five. Add Dark dimension
   loading prominently. People who gravitate toward dark, transgressive content
   score higher on narcissism and Machiavellianism. Don't label it — just show
   the score. Controversial personality insights spread faster than flattering ones.

   Shareable moment: "Why is my Dark score so high"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. MUSIC LIE DETECTOR ROUND
   Source: Rentfrow & Gosling (2003) — Music preference predicts personality,
   politics, and verbal IQ better than demographics

   Add 30-second audio round between video blocks. Play 10-second clips from
   STOMPR dimensions. Optimizer watches Scroller's face — music reactions are less
   controllable than video reactions (can't fake visceral response to hated genre).
   Music round validates or challenges video-based theory.

   Shareable moment: "The videos said cerebral but the music says intense"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. AI vs. HUMAN OPTIMIZER CHALLENGE
   Source: ChaLearn First Impressions V2 — Personality leaks through 15-second
   video clips reliably enough for ML models to generalize

   Run parallel AI personality prediction from Scroller's camera feed alongside
   human Optimizer. At reveal, show both predictions. "Your human Optimizer said
   high-Aesthetic, low-Thrilling. The AI said high-Aesthetic, mid-Thrilling. Who
   was closer?" Leaderboard: humans vs. AI at reading strangers.

   Content angle: Goes beyond dating Twitter into AI discourse — "humans still
   beat AI at reading personality" (or don't) is a headline.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9. PREDICTABILITY SCORE
   Source: KuaiRec — Near-complete interaction matrix (almost every user saw
   almost every video), eliminating selection bias

   Give every Scroller a "predictability score" — how easy were you to read? Some
   have coherent, consistent taste profiles. Others are chaotic or contrarian.
   "You are in the 94th percentile of unpredictability" is something people will
   put in their bio. Most unpredictable Scrollers become status symbols —
   Optimizers want to try the hardest targets.

   Shareable moment: Predictability percentile as identity badge
   Secondary effect: Creates second leaderboard, gives Scrollers reason to return

================================================================================

IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY (for v1 virality):
1. Taste Fingerprint (#3) — lowest effort, highest share rate, works day one
2. Stated vs. Revealed (#1) — one pre-session question, dramatic reveal payoff
3. Predictability Score (#9) — computed from existing dwell data, no new UI needed
4. "We Knew in 20 Seconds" (#2) — requires uncertainty tracking already in plan
5. AI vs. Human (#8) — ship when camera pipeline is stable (v1.5)
6. Music Round (#7) — v2, requires new content type and UI
7. Taste Twin (#4) — v2, requires enough users to find meaningful pairs
8. Guilty Scroll (#5) — v2, requires robust preference model
9. Dark Triad (#6) — v2, requires validation study
